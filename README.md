# Powerlifting Success Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes real-world powerlifting data from OpenPowerlifting to predict whether an athleteâ€™s lift attempt will be successful or failed using various machine learning models. The goal is to identify key factors affecting lift success and build an optimized predictive model.

## Dataset

- **Data Source:** [openpowerlifting-2024-01-06-4c732975.csv on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database/data?select=openpowerlifting-2024-01-06-4c732975.csv)
- Includes lifter details (weight class, sex, equipment type), lift type (squat, bench press, deadlift), and attempt outcomes.
- Preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, ANN

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations.
- Analyzed the impact of bodyweight, attempt number, lift type, and equipment on success probability.
- Identified and handled imbalanced class distributions

## Key Challenges & Improvements
- Handling imbalanced success/failure classes.
- Feature selection to improve model interpretability.
- Hyperparameter tuning for better generalization.
